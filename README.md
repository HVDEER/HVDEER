Hi, I’m Hadeer 🕯️<br/>  
<br/>  
Welcome to **The Velvet Scalpel** — where I dissect genomes, sculpt data into insight, and build machine learning pipelines that read between life's lines.🩸<br/>  
<br/>  
I work where biology meets code — turning raw data into insight, and questions into models.🧬<br/>  
<br/>  
I’ve studied genomes, built pipelines, and mapped signals no one else saw coming.<br/>  
My work moves between molecular biology, bioinformatics, and data science — quietly, precisely.🦉<br/>  
<br/>  
🧠 Focused on computational biology, cancer research, and algorithmic problem-solving<br/>  
💻 Skilled in Python, R, and SQL — equally fluent in research papers and Git commits<br/>  
🧫 Comfortable in labs, but more drawn to the silence of clean code and messy data<br/>  
⚙️ Currently working on the intersection of machine learning and life itself<br/>  
<br/>  
I don’t overshare, but the work speaks.🖤<br/>  
<br/>  
The work is technical. The thinking is personal. The outcomes — never random.<br/>  
Uncertainty is natural. I just quantify it.
